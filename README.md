# Introduction
ReqTrackManager is aiming to fill the market gap for teams (predominatly product development teams) that need a formal engineering requirements management system, but cannot afford propietory systems, and find other requirements software "not quite right" (generally because it's designed for continuous improvement/agile software teams).

This repository contains the project specifications for which ReqTrackManager is being developed to meet.

# Document Compiling
This specification is built using Quarto (https://quarto.org/) and weasyprint (https://weasyprint.org/). To compile, you will need to install quarto manually (the installer is on their website). weasyprint can easily be installed via package management. The dev environment that has been used to compile the document is PopOS.

# Other Notes
There is a harmonograph image generator in figures/cover/harmonograph. It's based on ChatGPT code. The aim for this is to develop an image for the front cover. There is still work to be done on this.
